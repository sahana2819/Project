                <h1><i>Web development</i></h1>
                <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet 
                    (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to 
                    complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to 
                    which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison,
                     client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

                    Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites:
                     writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier 
                     and available with basic technical skills.
                    
                    For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers)
                     and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only 
                     require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic
                      designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than
                       the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, 
                       back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user 
                       browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web with Tim Berners-Lee[4] developing the 
                       World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>
                       <h2>HTML</h2>
                       <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                         displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and 
                         scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into 
                        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
                         the appearance of the document.
                        
                        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such 
                        as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents 
                        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
                        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
                         Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. 
                            Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
                            <h2>Ajax</h2>
                            <p>Amsterdamsche Football Club Ajax (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈaːjɑks]), 
                                also known as AFC Ajax, Ajax Amsterdam, 
                                or simply Ajax, is a Dutch professional football club based in Amsterdam, 
                                that plays in the Eredivisie, the top tier in Dutch football. Historically, 
                                Ajax (named after the legendary Greek hero) is the most successful club in the Netherlands, 
                                with 36 Eredivisie titles and 20 KNVB Cups. It has continuously played in the Eredivisie, 
                                since the league's inception in 1956 and, along with Feyenoord and PSV Eindhoven, 
                                it is one of the country's "big three" clubs that have dominated that competition.

                                Ajax was one of the most successful clubs in the world in the 20th century.
                                 According to the IFFHS, Ajax were the seventh-most successful European club of the 20th century and The World's Club Team of the Year in 1992.[5] 
                                 According to German magazine Kicker, Ajax were the second-most successful European club of the 20th century. 
                                 The club is one of five teams that have earned the right to keep the European Cup and to wear a multiple-winner badge.

                                   <h2>React</h2>
                                   <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library[3] 
                                    for building user interfaces based on UI components.
                                     It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] 
                                     React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, 
                                     React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, 
                                     so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, 
                                     as well as certain client-side functionality.

                                     React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, who released an early prototype of React called "FaxJS".[32][33] 
                                     He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012.[34] 
                                     It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.[33]

                                     React Native, which enables native Android, iOS, and UWP development with React, 
                                     was announced at Facebook's React Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015.</p>
