                    <h3>I am a regular visitor to this hotel for its quality food. As its name goes, idly is the favourite dish here and the sambar they serve is the best sambar I have ever tasted in any hotel, surpassing even the sambar of five-star hotels. The idly is always served hot.
                        Idly is the ideal dish for south-indians as it is totally safe for any kind of stomach- condition. Chennai being an IT hub, a lot of bachelors stay here, eating out & I would recommend all of them to eat here to avoid any kind of health issue.
                        Other than their speciality dish, idly, you get other delicious dishes too, like dosai, vadai, chakkara pongal, kuzhipaniyaram etc.,
